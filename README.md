## Introduction

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an annual coding challenge that consists of a series of two-part problems released daily. This repository houses my solutions to the challenges for the year 2023, written in Java.

## Project Structure

The project follows a simple structure, with dedicated classes for each part of the problem, a `TextFileReader` class for reading puzzle inputs, and puzzle input files named `puzzle.txt`.

- **Main class**: Contains the main method to execute the solution.
- **One class**: Implements the solution for the first part of the daily problem.
- **Two class**: Implements the solution for the second part of the daily problem.
- **TextFileReader class**: Provides methods to read puzzle input from `puzzle.txt`.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/frjr17/advent-of-code-2023-java.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the specific day's branch:

   ```bash
   git checkout day-N
   ```

3. Run the Main class to see the solution:

   ```bash
   javac Main.java
   java -cp Main
   ```

Happy Xmas Coding!ðŸŽ…ðŸŽ„
